# Node JS Programming Practice

## Overview

This repository focuses on core and advanced JavaScript topics in the context of Node.js development. It includes foundational concepts of Node.js, module management with NPM, and detailed insights into JavaScript features relevant for server-side programming and asynchronous behavior.

## Main Topics Covered

### Node.js and NPM

- **NodeJS**: Introduction to Node.js environment, modules, and server-side scripting.
- **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: Managing packages, creating `package.json`, installing and using external libraries.

### JavaScript Core Concepts

- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Understanding classes, constructors, and prototypes in JavaScript.
- **Event Loop**: In-depth explanation of how JavaScript handles concurrency, macro and microtasks.
- **Event Handlers**: Responding to system or user events through callbacks and listeners.

### Type & Syntax Control

- **Type Conversions**: Implicit and explicit type casting in JavaScript.
- **"use strict"**: Enabling strict mode for safer and cleaner JavaScript code.
- **Comparisons**: Understanding equality (`==`, `===`), relational, and logical comparisons.
- **Conditional Branching**: Control flow with `if`, `else`, `switch`, and ternary operators.

### User Interaction (Browser Context)

- **alert, prompt, confirm**: Basic user interaction methods in the browser environment (demonstrated for concept understanding).

### Operators and Language Features

- **Logical & Nullish Coalescing Operator (`||`, `??`)**: Handling default values and nullish behavior.
- **Polyfills and Transpilers**: Ensuring backward compatibility and modern syntax support using Babel or similar tools.

### Functions and Control Flow

- **Recursion and Stack**: Recursive function design and call stack behavior.
- **Rest Parameters and Spread Syntax**: Flexible function arguments and object/array expansion.
- **Variable Scope and Closure**: Lexical scoping, block vs function scope, and closure utilization.

## Sub-topics Covered

- **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)**: Encapsulation of code and avoiding global scope pollution.
- **NFE (Named Function Expressions)**: Understanding their scope and recursion benefits.
- **"new Function" Syntax**: Creating functions dynamically at runtime using strings.
- **Scheduling**: Using `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and understanding the event loop's task queue.
- **Decorators and Forwarding**: Function wrappers to modify behavior or add features dynamically.
- **call/apply**: Invoking functions with explicit `this` and arguments list.
- **Function Binding**: Using `bind()` to permanently associate a function with a context (`this`).

This collection of practice exercises provides a solid understanding of JavaScript and Node.js features that are essential for backend development and full-stack programming.
